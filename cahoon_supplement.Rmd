Dillon is a pre-med student at NC State. Heâ€™s committed to major in biology and loves the hands-on work he gets to do shadowing scientists in the lab. He's very good at memorizing facts, especially when it comes to anatomy, but to apply to medical school, he has to complete a few math courses. He decides to start with statistics as his friends say it's an easy way to get an A. Unfortunately, they don't know he hates math and has not done much math beyond basic algebra since graduating from high school. Nevertheless, he knows he will need to develop some kind of statistical literacy to understand what a p-value is, so he signed up for introductory statistics. He hopes that he has a nice teacher.

# Does that make sense? 

---

# Some possible reasons

- A lot of **false positives**

--

- A lot of people are **not infected**

--

- There are two different conditional probabilities:

## <center>% of people with HIV given they tested positive</center>

## <center>vs</center>

## <center>% of people with a positive test given they have HIV</center>

# Bayes Theorem

## $$P (HIV | +) = \frac{P(+ \text{ and } HIV)}{P(+)}$$

## $$P (HIV | +) = \frac{P(+|HIV) P(HIV)}{P(+)}$$

## $$6.2\% = \frac{.977 * .005}{\frac{78,515}{1,000,000}}$$

# Bayes Theorem

We can generalize...

# Is the ELISA test any good?

- It is still effective (compare 6.2% to 0.5%)
